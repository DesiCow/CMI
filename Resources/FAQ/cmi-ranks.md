This is the recommended setup that works well with other plugins on Spigot / Paper 1.17.1.

## What is a Rankup System?

A 'default' player in the game can be active, levelling up on various statistics, gameplay elements, including levels and points for things like mcMMO and Jobs. As a player grows in their game they can automatically rank up. Going from a beginner to an elite player. You can pick the ranks with CMI, set them up to auto upgrade, and set the requirements. When a rank-up happens, commands can be executed. Which is super helpful to grant perks, manage the permissions involved, etc.
