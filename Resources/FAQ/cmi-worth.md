draft:
```
You can manually edit worth.yml or in-game with /cmi setworth
You can get a gui with missing worth items
And you can run a console command that auto calculates if it can figure out how to craft it from a raw material if it has a set value.
There's a module perhaps in modules.yml
There are sell and worth settings in config.yml

in console, you can find sell money economy and worth commands and permissions with:
cmi checkcommand <keyword> (like pay, money, sell, worth)
cmi checkperm <keyword> (like pay, money, sell, worth)

Combining cmi's interactive commands and stuff you can make an item shop sorta thing, but also have holograms you can right click to auto sell, or just walk up to to show worth value of what players are holding.
